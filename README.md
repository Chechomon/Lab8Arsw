## Prepare the app

* The application offers a REST service in which we can perform operations such as get, post, push and delete on the user and car entities.

* It is based on the controllers of two entities: user and car.

* The Procfile is always a simple text file that is named Procfile without a file extension. For example, Procfile.txt is not valid.The Procfile must live in your appâ€™s root directory. It does not function if placed anywhere else. A Procfile declares its process types on individual lines. The Procfile model of running processes types is extremely flexible. You can run any number of dynos with whatever arbitrary commands you want, and scale each independently.
